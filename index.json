Despite their advancements, however, the vast majority of prediction systems are specialized to a set of well-explored geographic regions or operational design domains, complicating deployment to additional cities, countries, or continents. Towards this end, we present a novel method for efficiently adapting behavior prediction models to new environments. Our approach leverages recent advances in meta-learning, specifically Bayesian regression, to augment existing behavior prediction models with an adaptive layer that enables efficient domain transfer via offline fine-tuning, online adaptation, or both. Experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can efficiently adapt to a variety of unseen environments.","tags":[],"title":"Expanding the Deployment Envelope of Behavior Prediction via Adaptive Meta-Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danfei Xu","Yuxiao Chen","Boris Ivanovic","Marco Pavone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663993319,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663993319,"objectID":"cbf6617d6768701bc17657f1de211bf3","permalink":"/publication/xu.chen.etal.arxiv2022/","publishdate":"2022-09-24T00:21:59-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/xu.chen.etal.arxiv2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Simulation is the key to scaling up validation and verification for robotic systems such as autonomous vehicles. Despite advances in high-fidelity physics and sensor simulation, a critical gap remains in simulating realistic behaviors of road users. This is because, unlike simulating physics and graphics, devising first principle models for human-like behaviors is generally infeasible. In this work, we take a data-driven approach and propose a method that can learn to generate traffic behaviors from real-world driving logs. The method achieves high sample efficiency and behavior diversity by exploiting the bi-level hierarchy of driving behaviors by decoupling the traffic simulation problem into high-level intent inference and low-level driving behavior imitation. The method also incorporates a planning module to obtain stable long-horizon behaviors. We empirically validate our method, named Bi-level Imitation for Traffic Simulation (BITS), with scenarios from two large-scale driving datasets and show that BITS achieves balanced traffic simulation performance in realism, diversity, and long-horizon stability. We also explore ways to evaluate behavior realism and introduce a suite of evaluation metrics for traffic simulation. Finally, as part of our core contributions, we develop and open source a software tool that unifies data formats across different driving datasets and converts scenes from existing datasets into interactive simulation environments.","tags":[],"title":"BITS: Bi-level Imitation for Traffic Simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yulong Cao","Danfei Xu","Xinshuo Weng","Z.

To overcome these challenges, a prominent approach is to convert the AV stack into an end-to-end neural network and train it with data. While such approaches have achieved impressive results, they typically lack interpretability and reusability, and they eschew principled analytical components, such as planning and control, in favor of deep neural networks. To enable the joint optimization of AV stacks while retaining modularity, we present DiffStack, a differentiable and modular stack for prediction, planning, and control. Crucially, our model-based planning and control algorithms leverage recent advancements in differentiable optimization to produce gradients, enabling optimization of upstream components, such as prediction, via backpropagation through planning and control. Our results on the nuScenes dataset indicate that end-to-end training with DiffStack yields substantial improvements in open-loop planning metrics by, e.g., learning to make fewer prediction errors that would affect planning.

Indeed, the high uncertainty inherent to the task of trajectory forecasting ensures that such mispredictions occur frequently. Motivated by the need to improve safety of autonomous vehicles without compromising on their performance, we develop a probabilistic run-time monitor that detects when a harmful prediction failure occurs, i.e., a task-relevant failure detector. We achieve this by propagating trajectory prediction errors to the planning cost to reason about their impact on the AV. Furthermore, our detector comes equipped with performance measures on the false-positive and the false-negative rate and allows for data-free calibration.

Specifically, we show that (i) existing predominant safety concepts can be embedded in the HJ reachability framework, thereby enabling a common language for comparing and contrasting modeling assumptions, and (ii) HJ reachability can serve as an inductive bias to effectively reason, in a learning context, about two critical, yet often overlooked aspects of safety: responsibility and context-dependency.","tags":[],"title":"Towards Data-Driven Synthesis of Autonomous Vehicle Safety Concepts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boris Ivanovic","Richard Lin","Shubham Shrivastava","Punarjay Chakravarty","Marco Pavone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645539719,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645539719,"objectID":"745196eca410cc04a2b6ffba2c223012","permalink":"/publication/ivanovic.lin.etal.icra2022/","publishdate":"2022-02-22T10:21:59-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ivanovic.lin.etal.icra2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Uncertainty pervades through the modern robotic autonomy stack, with nearly every component (e.g., sensors, detection, classification, tracking, behavior prediction) producing continuous or discrete probabilistic distributions. Trajectory forecasting, in particular, is surrounded by uncertainty as its inputs are produced by (noisy) upstream perception and its outputs are predictions that are often probabilistic for use in downstream planning. However, most trajectory forecasting methods do not account for upstream uncertainty, instead taking only the most-likely values. As a result, perceptual uncertainties are not propagated through forecasting and predictions are frequently overconfident. To address this, we present a novel method for incorporating perceptual state uncertainty in trajectory forecasting, a key component of which is a new statistical distance-based loss function which encourages predicting uncertainties that better match upstream perception.

In this work, we present ScePT, a policy planning-based trajectory prediction model that generates accurate, scene-consistent trajectory predictions suitable for autonomous system motion planning.

This is typically caused by the propagation of errors from tracking to prediction, such as noisy tracks, fragments and identity switches. To alleviate this propagation of errors, we propose a new prediction pipeline that only requires detections and their affinity matrices across frames as inputs, entirely removing the need for error-prone data association during tracking. Since affinity matrices contain 'soft' information about the similarity and identity of detections across frames, predicting directly from them retains strictly more information than using the tracklets generated by data association in tracking. Thorough experiments on large-scale, real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our affinity-based prediction scheme reduces overall prediction errors by up to 60.2%, in comparison to standard prediction pipelines that use tracklets as inputs, with even more significant error reduction (up to 88.2%) if restricting the evaluation to challenging scenarios with tracking errors.","tags":[],"title":"Whose Track Is It Anyway?

It is therefore desirable that the evaluation metric for the perception system captures the safety-criticality of objects. Unfortunately, existing perception evaluation metrics tend to make strong assumptions about the objects and ignore the dynamic interactions between agents, and thus do not accurately capture the safety risks in reality. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an interaction-dynamics-aware obstacle detection evaluation metric by accounting for closed-loop dynamic interactions between an ego vehicle and obstacles in the scene. By borrowing existing theory from optimal control theory, namely Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, we present a computationally tractable method for constructing a ''safety zone'': a region in state space that defines where safety-critical obstacles lie for the purpose of defining safety metrics. Our proposed safety zone is mathematically complete, and can be easily computed to reflect a variety of safety requirements.

Nevertheless, there has been less attention given to the principled integration of these components, particularly in terms of the characterization and mitigation of cascading errors. This paper addresses the problem of cascading errors by focusing on the coupling between the tracking and prediction modules. First, by using state-of-the-art tracking and prediction tools, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of how severely errors stemming from tracking can impact prediction performance. On the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, we find that predictions consuming tracked trajectories as inputs (the typical case in practice) can experience a significant (even order of magnitude) drop in performance in comparison to the idealized setting where ground truth past trajectories are used as inputs. To address this issue, we propose a multi-hypothesis tracking and prediction framework. Rather than relying on a single set of tracking results for prediction, our framework simultaneously reasons about multiple sets of tracking results, thereby increasing the likelihood of including accurate tracking results as inputs to prediction. We show that this framework improves overall prediction performance over the standard single-hypothesis tracking-prediction pipeline by up to 34.2% on the nuScenes dataset, with even more significant improvements (up to ~70%) when restricting the evaluation to challenging scenarios involving identity switches and fragments -- all with an acceptable computation overhead.","tags":[],"title":"MTP: Multi-Hypothesis Tracking and Prediction for Reduced Error Propagation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boris Ivanovic","Marco Pavone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633616519,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633616519,"objectID":"5f44dc5706c218f4690627221a0dea3c","permalink":"/publication/ivanovic.pavone.iv2022/","publishdate":"2021-10-07T10:21:59-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ivanovic.pavone.iv2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Detecting other agents and forecasting their behavior is an integral part of the modern robotic autonomy stack, especially in safety-critical scenarios entailing human-robot interaction such as autonomous driving.
