Trajectory forecasting, in particular, is surrounded by uncertainty as its inputs are produced by (noisy) upstream perception and its outputs are predictions that are often probabilistic for use in downstream planning. However, most trajectory forecasting methods do not account for upstream uncertainty, instead taking only the most-likely values. As a result, perceptual uncertainties are not propagated through forecasting and predictions are frequently overconfident. To address this, we present a novel method for incorporating perceptual state uncertainty in trajectory forecasting, a key component of which is a new statistical distance-based loss function which encourages predicting uncertainties that better match upstream perception. We evaluate our approach both in illustrative simulations and on large-scale, real-world data, demonstrating its efficacy in propagating perceptual state uncertainty through prediction and producing more calibrated predictions.","tags":[],"title":"Propagating State Uncertainty Through Trajectory Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxiao Chen","Boris Ivanovic","Marco Pavone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645539719,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645539719,"objectID":"036eb23d1c04ea8a8ac681201baf686f","permalink":"/publication/chen.ivanovic.etal.arxiv2022/","publishdate":"2022-02-22T10:21:59-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chen.ivanovic.etal.arxiv2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ScePT: Scene-consistent, Policy-based Trajectory Predictions for Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xinshuo Weng","Boris Ivanovic","Kris Kitani","Marco Pavone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645539719,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645539719,"objectID":"40843bf2e5b87dc1d87f855d690a23e5","permalink":"/publication/weng.ivanovic.etal.arxiv2022/","publishdate":"2022-02-22T10:21:59-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/weng.ivanovic.etal.arxiv2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Whose Track Is It Anyway?

Nevertheless, there has been less attention given to the principled integration of these components, particularly in terms of the characterization and mitigation of cascading errors. This paper addresses the problem of cascading errors by focusing on the coupling between the tracking and prediction modules. First, by using state-of-the-art tracking and prediction tools, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of how severely errors stemming from tracking can impact prediction performance. On the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, we find that predictions consuming tracked trajectories as inputs (the typical case in practice) can experience a significant (even order of magnitude) drop in performance in comparison to the idealized setting where ground truth past trajectories are used as inputs. To address this issue, we propose a multi-hypothesis tracking and prediction framework. Rather than relying on a single set of tracking results for prediction, our framework simultaneously reasons about multiple sets of tracking results, thereby increasing the likelihood of including accurate tracking results as inputs to prediction. We show that this framework improves overall prediction performance over the standard single-hypothesis tracking-prediction pipeline by up to 34.2% on the nuScenes dataset, with even more significant improvements (up to ~70%) when restricting the evaluation to challenging scenarios involving identity switches and fragments -- all with an acceptable computation overhead.","tags":[],"title":"MTP: Multi-Hypothesis Tracking and Prediction for Reduced Error Propagation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boris Ivanovic","Marco Pavone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633616519,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633616519,"objectID":"5f44dc5706c218f4690627221a0dea3c","permalink":"/publication/ivanovic.pavone.iv2022/","publishdate":"2021-10-07T10:21:59-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ivanovic.pavone.iv2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Detecting other agents and forecasting their behavior is an integral part of the modern robotic autonomy stack, especially in safety-critical scenarios entailing human-robot interaction such as autonomous driving.
